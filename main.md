For any successful stockbroker, a majority of retail clients will almost certainly be from white households. The idea that there was a cost to African-American FAs in accessing social networks of wealthy individuals was a strong theme running through the testimony of company officials.

<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>African-Americans were often socially isolated at the firm, in part because so few other African-Americans held similar positions: Only 2% of FAs at the company were African-American, and “more than 85% of the company’s offices had no African-American FAs.” This isolation had an impact on their ability to join brokerage teams, which are crucial for gaining access to accounts, particularly in the early years of a career. While 41.6% of non-African-American financial advisers were able to join broker teams, that was true for just 11.6% of African-American brokers.</li>
    <li>Early inequality tended to build on itself: Broker teams kept key accounts to themselves, further disadvantaging those not on teams. “Because inherited accounts allow financial advisers to qualify for other resources &#8212; including additional inherited accounts &#8212; this disadvantage to [financial advisers] locked out from this kind of ‘regifting’ is cumulative.”</li>
    <li>Although the firm appointed racial minorities to lead projects when it marketed its services to multicultural communities, “this approach led to racialized jobs and constrained opportunities for African-Americans, and the company’s policies and practices along these lines were perceived as such by African-American [financial advisers].”</li>
    <li>The firm implemented of number of diversity-related programs, both company-wide and within its brokerage division, but did so “in a context of ambiguous, unstable, and diffuse structures of responsibility and authority.” The resulting dynamics supported earlier scholarship that such efforts “typically have little impact on discriminatory workplace barriers and often do more harm than good.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The researcher notes that “African-Americans who seek to work as financial advisers may in fact encounter obstacles to acquiring wealthy clients that are not faced by their white counterparts.” One suggested remedy is for financial services firms to “proactively manage the distribution of productivity-enhancing resources so as to avoid reproducing institutionalized racism from the outside and perpetuating sources of racial bias arising from the inside.”</p> ---

This tudy finds that while job seekers perceive certain benefits to using SNS, the use of SNS also raises difficult strategic dilemmas and obstacles for job seekers.  At core, SNS increase the exposure of job seekers, but as the data presented in this paper will show, this exposure is double-edged.  The same visibility that makes it easier for job seekers to expand their networks and for employers to find and recruit them, also makes it easier for employers to classify, rank, compare, and screen out entire categories of job seekers.  The visibility of workers on SNS has wide ranging effects, such as employers seeing pictorial images or the political activities of job seekers early in the vetting process, or for reasons that will be described in this paper, disadvantaging workers who are generalists and do not have a clear and easy-to-categorize career, and workers whose work histories are not optimally presented in a reverse chronological format.  

SNS intermediation of the labor market has two kinds of effects: 
First, as a filtering mechanism for hiring, SNS produces labor market winners and losers involving processes that often have little to do with evaluations of merit.  Second, these new filtering mechanisms also exerts new pressures on all workers, whether winners or losers as perceived through this new filter, to manage their careers, and to some extent their private lives, in particular ways that

A true rationale for diversity and inclusion is needed. 


VVV

In “White Normativity: The Cultural Dimemsions of Whiteness in a Racially Diverse LGBT Organization,” Jane Ward investigates the function of race and whiteness in a racially diverse LGBT center in Los Angeles. To Ward, . This is evident in the way the LGBT community center in Los Angeles is racialized by its constituents. While half of the staff at the center identified as people of color, the organization was viewed as a “white” center by members of the larger Los Angeles LGBT community. 
Ward argues that the perceived “whiteness” of the center was a result of an institutionalized form of white normalcy that privileged white experiences, and made staff and patrons of color as “the other”. Ward also suggests that these white normative practices are the result of (567). These events, Ward says, suggested that (573).

Diversity Day at the center was criticized as being a practice that mostly benefited white employees, validated the experiences of white employees over those of color, and made inac curate generalizations about the cultures of non-white employees (573). More critically, Ward suggests that this type of programming emphasized the need for a rationale for diversity, implying that diversity alone has no “intrinsic moral value.” While Ward does not speak at length on class specifically, the corporate model she describes carries classed connotations. While this corporate model of diversity validates white experiences, it also validates the experience of the powerful and privileged over the oppressed. By adopting corporate practices that are associated with whiteness and the privileged middle class, the organization links itself to the “Normal Gay” described by Seidman. While this Normal Gay image can be useful in legitimizing the center as an institution, it also creates class and race alienation even within organizations that are racially diverse.

Diversity tactics have become government policy in the past half-century, yet even as diverse a workplace can get, the tactics can still enable a white normative structure in organization (Ward 2008). Jane Ward (2008) depicts the white normativity of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center that overshadows the fifty-two percent staff of color. This white normative concept speaks of white ideology that conducts particular embedded norms on communication and behavior in a hierarchy of dominance (Ward 2008).  (Ward 2008). In efforts to expand diversity, members of the committee for these efforts differed by race on how to approach the issue (Ward 2008). 
 (Ward 2008). The ideas from the members of color seemed impractical by white members and were even ignored at times, while the voice with real conception of diversity should have been understood with privilege (Ward 2008). The members of color on the committee argued that the Center should already be or already is “an organization of color” (Ward 2008). Whiteness even in minority majority setting has a rude depth that needs deconstructing in these especially LGBTQ+ spaces.

despite this movement toward racial diversification, the Center still maintained a local reputation among queer people of color as “the white” LGBT organization in Los Angeles. As Jane has argued in her analysis of the Center (Ward, 2008b), to understand this apparent contradiction requires examination not only of whether – but also how and why – the Center had come to value and promote racial diversity. By most accounts, true diversity is measured by structural change, wherein organizations move beyond tokenism and include both a critical mass of people of color (and white women, queers, and the poor and working-class) at all levels of the organization. Yet as the case of the Center illustrates, structural change is not always the end of the story about intersectionality. During fieldwork and interviews, employees of color at the Center reported that although the organization's demographics and programs had changed for the better, the organization's culture was marked by an excessive focus on declaring its own racial diversity for funders and other organizations. The Center's constant promotion of its own diversity – a strategy brought to the organization by leaders (both whites and people of color) who drew on their previous corporate sector experience with diversity management and public relations – became the very practice that many employees of color identified as evidence of the “white corporate culture” of the organization. As in the corporate environment, diversification had indeed taken place at the Center, yet “diversity” (the word and the idea) had also become a normalizing force in the organization. It had become overused, empty, and “white.”
