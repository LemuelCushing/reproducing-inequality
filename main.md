Published in 78 but quoted as 80. Meh.

It's main claim - after the 60s, race was becoming less of a deciding factor in the life chances of black Americans than **class**.

### Wilson attributed the gains to these factors:

* Expansion of the Service Sector
* Opportunities in the Public Sector
* Affirmative Action and other anti-discrimination efforts

התרחבות המגזר השירותי, הזדמנויות במגזר הציבורי וההשפעה של תוכניות נגד אפלייה.

### Precariousness opportunities  

`Collins`{Collins, Sharon. 1997. Black corporate executives: The making and breaking of a black middle class. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press.|1} and `Spalter-Roth and Deitch`{Spalter-Roth, Roberta, and Cynthia Deitch. 1999. 1 don't feel right sized, I feel out-of-work sized: Gender, race, ethnicity, and the unequal costs of displacement. Work and Occupations 26:446-82.|1} point to the various ways in which African Americans are **channeled** into niche fields.

`Wilson et al.`{Wilson, George, and Debra McBrier. 2005. Race and loss of privilege: African American/white differences in the determinants of layoffs from upper-tier occupations. Sociological Forum 20:301-21.| 1} {Wilson, George, and Vincent J. Roscigno. 2010. Race and downward mobility from privileged occupations: African American/white dynamics across the early work-career. Social Science Research 39:67-77.|1} developed the **Minority Vulnerability Thesis** as a framework for understanding racial inequality vis-à-vis career stability in mid- to upper-level occupations.

### Data and methods

Expert witness reports from an employment discrimination litigation.

Two _Theories of the Case_:

##### The company
The cause of the disparities are external to the company policies - the inherent lack of social capital leads to lower earnings, in a meritocratic system where 'connections' and 'networks' are the very core of the enterprise.

--

<blockquote>
For any successful stockbroker, a majority of retail clients will almost certainly be from white households. The idea that there was a cost to African-American FAs in accessing social networks of wealthy individuals was a strong theme running through the testimony of company officials.
</blockquote>

--

##### The plaintiffs
A skewed compensation system created a self-reproducing hierarchy of unofficial cliques.

African-Americans were often socially isolated at the firm, in part because so few other African-Americans held similar positions: Only 2% of FAs at the company were African-American, and “more than 85% of the company’s offices had no African-American FAs.

### The issue being..

<blockquote>
A cumulative advantage system is not inherently discriminatory, so long as disparities are attributable to individual differences in productivity and have not emerged as a result of differential, discriminatory treatment by the organization.

### “opportunity hoarding” 

<blockquote style="font-size:70%;">
If members of a network acquire access to a resource that is valuable, renewable, subject to monopoly, supportive of network activities, and enhanced by the network’s modus operandi, network members regularly hoard access to the resource, creating beliefs and practices that sustain their control. If that network is categorically bounded, opportunity hoarding thereby contributes to the maintenance of categorical inequality.

### Company attempts at addressing the inequality

* Services to multicultural communities = Racialized jobs with constrained opportunities
* "Ambiguous, unstable, and diffuse structures of responsibility and authority" in diversity-related programs

* Proactively manage the distribution of productivity-enhancing resources so as to avoid reproducing institutionalized racism from the outside and perpetuating sources of racial bias arising from the inside.

<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>African-Americans were often socially isolated at the firm, in part because so few other African-Americans held similar positions: Only 2% of FAs at the company were African-American, and “more than 85% of the company’s offices had no African-American FAs.” This isolation had an impact on their ability to join brokerage teams, which are crucial for gaining access to accounts, particularly in the early years of a career. While 41.6% of non-African-American financial advisers were able to join broker teams, that was true for just 11.6% of African-American brokers.</li>
    <li>Early inequality tended to build on itself: Broker teams kept key accounts to themselves, further disadvantaging those not on teams. “Because inherited accounts allow financial advisers to qualify for other resources &#8212; including additional inherited accounts &#8212; this disadvantage to [financial advisers] locked out from this kind of ‘regifting’ is cumulative.”</li>
    <li>Although the firm appointed racial minorities to lead projects when it marketed its services to multicultural communities, “this approach led to racialized jobs and constrained opportunities for African-Americans, and the company’s policies and practices along these lines were perceived as such by African-American [financial advisers].”</li>
    <li>The firm implemented of number of diversity-related programs, both company-wide and within its brokerage division, but did so “in a context of ambiguous, unstable, and diffuse structures of responsibility and authority.” The resulting dynamics supported earlier scholarship that such efforts “typically have little impact on discriminatory workplace barriers and often do more harm than good.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The researcher notes that “African-Americans who seek to work as financial advisers may in fact encounter obstacles to acquiring wealthy clients that are not faced by their white counterparts.” One suggested remedy is for financial services firms to “proactively manage the distribution of productivity-enhancing resources so as to avoid reproducing institutionalized racism from the outside and perpetuating sources of racial bias arising from the inside.”</p> ---
